Bush started to look more like a man at the end of his rope than the leader of a unified country. A year ago, he was coasting, but now the cracks are showing, and they‚Äôre breaking fast. The midterms seem to be just the start‚Äîhis grip on power is starting to slip, and the 1992 election is fast approaching, but it feels like he's fumbling with no clear way out.<br><br>For all his talk about a gentler, kinder nation, Bush‚Äôs heart has always been more in foreign policy than the problems eating away at America on the homefront. His domestic agenda feels weak, and his dispassionate, often hesitant approach to handling the recession, growing debt, and rising recession has left many Americans wondering if he even understands the issues that matter to them.<br><br>His vice president? The one he has grown close to, and once upon a time trusted to be the face of a new, energetic, middle-class GOP? Being torn down to a laughingstock by the liberal media, with ambitious, restless personalities wanting to replace him. There‚Äôs a sense of unease in the air, not just directed at him, but at the entire political system. People are restless, and that unease is growing every day.<br><br>All Bush can do now is to try and ward off a far-right revolt in the Republican Party, as he prays for a rebound in his approval ratings while he faces down a stagnating economy, the looming Democratic challenger, and whatever else might come his way. The question is whether he can hold together the crumbling fa√ßade of his leadership of a country that's losing faith in the system he represents.</div>","image_url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/gamble:119/datastream/JPG/view","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://i.imgur.com/p0SZpjA.png","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":15,"year":1988,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"‚Ñùùïñùïíùïï ùïÑùï™ ùïùùïöùï°ùï§"}];e.credits = "POW";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":30,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":152,"fields":{"first_name":"George H.W","last_name":"Bush","election":15,"party":"Republican Party","state":"Texas","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><b><i>Conservatism.

A military veteran, CIA director, and ambassador to the U.N., George Bush has seen it all. However, whenever he has been seen, he has been seen as a man controlled by a higher power -- certainly not God -- whose inconsistencies and broken promises, such as raising taxes, have been his greatest weakness.
