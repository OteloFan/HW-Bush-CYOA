Bush started to look more like a man at the end of his rope than the leader of a unified country. A year ago, he was coasting, but now the cracks are showing, and they‚Äôre breaking fast. The midterms seem to be just the start‚Äîhis grip on power is starting to slip, and the 1992 election is fast approaching, but it feels like he's fumbling with no clear way out.<br><br>For all his talk about a gentler, kinder nation, Bush‚Äôs heart has always been more in foreign policy than the problems eating away at America on the homefront. His domestic agenda feels weak, and his dispassionate, often hesitant approach to handling the recession, growing debt, and rising recession has left many Americans wondering if he even understands the issues that matter to them.<br><br>His vice president? A liability, at best, and the public is starting to feel it. There‚Äôs a sense of unease in the air, not just directed at him, but at the entire political system. People are restless, and that unease is growing every day.<br><br>All Bush can do now is try to hold onto the right flank, praying for a rebound in approval, while he faces down the looming Democratic challenger and whatever else might come his way. The question is s whether he can hold together the crumbling fa√ßade of leadership in a country that‚Äôs losing faith in the system he represents.</div>","image_url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/gamble:119/datastream/JPG/view","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"https://i.imgur.com/OK1dgNU.png","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":15,"year":1988,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"‚Ñùùïñùïíùïï ùïÑùï™ ùïùùïöùï°ùï§"}];e.credits = "POW";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":30,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":152,"fields":{"first_name":"George H.W","last_name":"Bush","election":15,"party":"Republican Party","state":"Texas","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><b><i>Conservativism.

A military veteran, CIA director, and ambassador to the U.N., George Bush has seen it all. However, whenever he has been seen, he has been seen as a man controlled by a higher power -- certainly not God -- whose inconsistencies and broken promises, such as raised taxes, have been his greatest weakness. For a man whose life has been defined by the establishment, it is striking that Bush craves to be lauded as a brilliant maverick. Yet his political instincts, addicted to prudence and catering to the center, just won't let him. <br><br>It has been two years since Herb Bush was elected President of the United States, riding the coattails of his old boss, the living god of conservatism, Ronald Reagan.
